Also, suppose you dislike writing and want to strategically analyze all the UCSD college writing courses, to figure out colleges to avoid applying to and colleges where you have the best shot at getting a decent grade. Luckily, UCSD has data on its CAPES website about writing courses (except for Muir's writing course due to unknown reasons). Each row corresponds to a particular quarter and course, and the data includes the name of the course, the average study hours per week for the quarter, and the average grade for the quarter (on a GPA scale). Now it's time to analyze and figure out whether the writing course rumors are true (or people just like complaining). "
